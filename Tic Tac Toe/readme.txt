Tic Tac Toe online created with Flask, SocketIO and p5.js.
The initial assignment was given to us by the professor to make a console tic tac toe with python so I decided to take it
a step further and make it a web game where the server is written in Python(Flask) and the client code uses p5.js to render 
the game. SocketIO was used to link the client adn the server.
The game logic(variable and function names) is written in french but the rest of the code(comments) and variables is in English
